https://SarahChun6.github.io/sp25-cse110-lab3
## Notes about validation errors: 
- Added fallbacks for Wider-gamut colors (that would not validate) on lines 145 and 168.
- Not sure why nested selectors did not parse in validator.
## Notes about issues and pull requests:
- Created issue templates from Settings but not sure where to resolve them after finishing the task.
- Forgot to do pull requests while doing Part 2: CSS, but did a pull request at the end.
